This Repository contains a collection of unsatisfiable SAT formulas.
All formulas were generated by procedures defined in [satqubolib](https://github.com/ZielinskiSebastian/satqubolib/).
These procedures include noTriangle, Random and Balanced.
<br /> 
For a MAXSAT solver the [Loandra](https://github.com/jezberg/loandra) Solver was used. This solver performed very well in the [2024 MAXSAT Competition](https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2024/index.html).
If you want to use this solver follow the build instructions in the repository and make sure the formulas are in wncf format.
Also, most MAXSAT solvers do not maximize clauses for unsatisfiable formulas, Loandra optimizes the number of clauses even if the formula is UNSAT.
<br />
This repository contains the amount of unsatisfiable clauses for each formula and the solution time the solver took in seconds.
For each formula the solver had allocated solution time of 2h (7200s). If it's exceeded, the solution process is cutoff.

This data is recorded in the tables folder for all procedures.
